# Satellites-Above
A (currently) command-line C++ application that gets your location, pipes it into an API and notifies you what type of satellites are above you.  You can then select specific satellites to see more information.

## Required Libraries

## Next Steps
The goal is eventually to eventually have this set up in a satellite pointer embedded electronics project.  

Refactor my vectors, to be arrays.  Pointers scare me. D:

Create a GUI for the application, rather than relying on a console application

Build the actual embedded electronics satellite pointer thing.

Create a C-based program that can be used on the satellite pointer thing.
